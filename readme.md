The `Ruka` programming language

# Brief Overview
`Ruka` is a compiled, full-stack, programming language with a focus on simplicity and easy of use. For now, targeting arm64 and wasm for the backend, and javascript and wasm for the frontend.

In a *prophesized* future where processors with programmable logic (ie. Xilinx Zync, Intel Cyclone SoCs) becomes more ubiquitous; Ruka will also allow designing and interfacing FPGA hardware, combined with frontend UI and backend servers all written primarily in `Ruka`; treating all three as first-class citizens with all the complexity handled on your behalf by the compiler.

# Installation
When `Ruka` reaches a usable state, the instructions for installing and using the tools will live here.
